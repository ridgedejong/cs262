## CS 262 - Lab 02

This lab is based on [Lab 2: Project Management](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/02management/lab.html)

Answers to lab questions:

- This application uses multiple core components: View, Text, TextInput, StyleSheet, Button, and FlatList

- A prop used is 'backgroundColor' in the buttonContainer, and a state element is 'name' which can be changed with setName

- Curly braces are used in JSX code in order to write JavaScript code

- One anonymous function is when the value of the textInput is passed to the setName function:
onChangeText={(val) => setName(val)}

- When run on Android or iOS the application uses components from React Native similar to HTML and CSS to render, but technically does not use HTML or CSS

1. A workout app that helps you keep track of your progess. The entire app would be focused on simplicity and easily accessed buttons since you wouldn't want to mess with your phone too much when you're trying to workout. First, you can choose what area of the body you want to exercise, then your difficulty. The app would have to be able to access these different exercise routines from somewhere. Throughout the workout your phone shows what exercise to do and how many reps/how long, and you click a button after you finish to go to the next. There could be a progress bar to show much you have left, and there could be a timer for certain exercises that use time instead of reps. There could be motivating messages and breaks interwoven in the workout.

2. An app that tracks your spending habits. It can give you weekly or monthly reports of how much money you've spent in certain categories. It could give you advice on how to cut down on certain spending and suggest alternatives, like buying Meijer brand milk instead of Country Fresh or investing the $100 you just spent on headphones. Along with this it could give investing advice and inform you about the many different ways to invest money. It would almost be a jack-of-all-trades app for your financial planning.

Static code analysis of WelcomeScreen.js using ESLint

Changes:
- Formatted code using Shift+Alt+f
- Added comments (JSDoc) throughout to help clarify
- Got rid of import Button since Touchable Opacity used instead
- Got rid of import AntDesign since icons not used in this modal
- Fixed prop validation by adding property validation statement for endTour getting passed 
- University's and Let's were replaced with University&apos;s and Let&apos;s to follow standards

These changes can be found in campusCrawl-client repo in the format/welcome-screen branch. It has not been merged with master since other changes have been made and I do not want to deploy features to master that are still in development.
